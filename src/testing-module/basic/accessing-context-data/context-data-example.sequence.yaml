title: "Test 1: Pipeline Sequence"

description: |
  This sequence demonstrates how to access data from different contexts within a pipeline.
  It includes workflows that utilize results context and custom variables to share data between steps.

sequence:
  - id: workflow1
    block: AccessDataUsingResultsContextWorkflow

  - id: workflow2
    block: AccessDataUsingCustomVariableWorkflow

  - id: workflow3
    block: AccessDataFromArgumentsWorkflow

    # pass in the message from workflow 2 as argument
    args:
      message: ${ steps.workflow2.message }
