title: "Test 5: Conditional Pipeline Sequence"

description: |
  This sequence demonstrates conditional execution of workflows based on input arguments.
  It includes an initial workflow that always runs, followed by two conditional workflows
  that execute based on the value of the inputPath argument.

sequence:
  - id: initial
    block: AlwaysExecutedWorkflow
    args:
      inputPath: ${ args.inputPath }

  # Option 1: Use Handlebars template expression to evaluate
  - id: workflowA
    block: ConditionalPathAWorkflow
    condition: "{{#if (eq args.inputPath 'A')}}1{{/if}}"

  # Option 2: Use custom pipeline getter method to evaluate condition
  - id: workflowB
    block: ConditionalPathBWorkflow
    condition: ${ isPathB }
