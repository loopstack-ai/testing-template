title: 'Test 4: Dynamic Routing'

description: |
  This workflow demonstrates dynamic routing based on the value of a variable.
  It uses the SwitchTarget tool to determine the next transition based on conditions.

transitions:
  - id: create_mock_data
    from: start
    to: prepared
    call:
      - tool: CreateChatMessage
        args:
          role: 'assistant'
          content: "Analysing value = {{ args.value }}"

  - id: router
    from: prepared
    to:
      - placeA
      - placeB
    call:

      # Option 1: use SwitchTarget tool with Handelbars template expression to determine target place
      - tool: SwitchTarget
        args:
          target: "{{#if (gt args.value 100)}}placeA{{else}}placeB{{/if}}"

  - id: value_gt_100
    from: placeA
    to:
      - placeC
      - placeD
    call:
      # Option 2: use SwitchTarget tool with custom workflow getter function to determine target place
      - tool: SwitchTarget
        args:
          target: ${ routeGt200 }

  - id: value_lte_100
