title: "Test 2: Pipeline Factory"

description: |
  This workflow demonstrates the factory pattern by processing a list of fruits.
  Each fruit is processed using the ProcessItemWorkflow in parallel.

parallel: true                                 # Run all instances in parallel. Defaults to false.

factory:
  block: ProcessItemWorkflow

iterator:
  source: ${ fruits }

namespace:
  label: Fruits
